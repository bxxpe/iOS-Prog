print(1 == 1)  // Equal to, true because 1 is equal to 1
print(2 != 1)  // Not Equal to, true because 2 is not equal to 1
print(2 > 1)   // Greater than, true because 2 is greater than 1
print(1 < 2)   // Less than, true because 1 is less than 2
print(1 >= 1)  // Greater than or Equal to, true because 1 is equal to 1
print(2 <= 1)  // Less or Equal to, false because 2 is not less than or equal to 1
